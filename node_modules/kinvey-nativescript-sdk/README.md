# Overview

[Kinvey](http://www.kinvey.com) (pronounced Kin-vey, like convey) makes it ridiculously easy for developers to setup, use and operate a cloud backend for their mobile apps. They don't have to worry about connecting to various cloud services, setting up servers for their backend, or maintaining and scaling them.

This SDK makes it easy to connect your [Nativescript](https://www.nativescript.org/) apps with Kinvey.

## How to use

#### Install the NativeScript plugin

```
tns plugin add kinvey-nativescript-sdk
```

#### Install via npm

```javascript
npm install --save kinvey-nativescript-sdk
```

Import the Kinvey NativeScript SDK (ES6/TypeScript):

```javascript
import { Kinvey } from 'kinvey-nativescript-sdk';
```

A [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) type definition file is included in the distribution and will automatically be picked up by the TypeScript compiler.
